# ShapeDetectionv3

A Python project that detects and tracks geometric shapes (circles, triangles, squares, rectangles)using OpenCV and Kalman filtering.

## Features
- Close to Real-time shape and tracking
- Kalman filter for object tracking
- Shape detection (triangle/square/rectangle/circle)

## Installation
- pip install opencv-python numpy Pillow

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
### Limitations
- kalman filter only assumes linear motion

 ### How to Use
- python run.py
